The ChatServer.jar executable can be run on any computer, but it is mostly
designed to run on a server machine where port 8080 is accessible from the
Internet. The SeizureSpeed app requires the URL of a server for its Chat
and Leaderboard features. This URL should be formatted like this:

	cnchat.server.com


If you would like to host a version of ChatServer, Cloud9 (https://c9.io)
has a free service that allows users to manage their machine and develop
code in their browser. After signing up, you should create a blank
workspace, and run the following commands:
	
	apt-get update
	apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk

Then you can use the sample script below to get the server running.


#!/bin/bash
BRANCHNAME="master"
cd /home/ubuntu/workspace
git clone https://github.com/dylanburati/CNChat.git
cd CNChat
git checkout $BRANCHNAME
git reset --hard origin/$BRANCHNAME
unzip src.zip -d src
cd src/ChatServer
javac ChatServer.java
cd ../ChatClient
javac ChatClient.java
cd ..
find . -name \*.java -delete
jar cvfmM ChatClient.jar ./ChatClient/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -C ChatClient .
jar cvfmM ChatServer.jar ./ChatServer/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -C ChatServer .
mv -f ./*.jar ../bin/
cd ..
chmod 744 ./bin/*.jar
java -jar ./bin/ChatServer.jar >/dev/null 2>&1 &


The first 8 lines of the script, up to and including the unzip command,
retrieve the code and extract it. If you want to run an altered version of
ChatServer, you should edit the file src/ChatServer.java after running
these commands.

The next 9 lines of the script recompile the .jar files, because the
default ChatClient.jar and ChatServer.jar will only run on Java 1.8. Java
1.7 is the version used by most Cloud9 workspaces.

The last 3 lines of the script finish preparing the .jar executables, and
start a process for ChatServer. The last command is designed to run
ChatServer silently and in the background; if you are not sure it will work,
run this command instead:

	java -jar ./bin/ChatServer.jar


This command stops the chat server and all other java programs running:

	killall -9 java


Thanks for trying out CNChat!
